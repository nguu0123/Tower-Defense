First 3 weeks:
   Adding basic game logic: class Grid and the logic classes (direction, velocity,..). Logic class has been tested by manual testing: create test and compare it with result computed by hand
   Making the first enemy type: can find their own way through the map by moving to the next similar square, have running and dieing animation
   Making the first tower type: can target the enemy ans shoot a projectile to it.
   Filemanger can load map and will then be implemented to load and save game
   Handling input from the user is hard and intelliJ mis-compile scalafx with javafx => fix by adding scalafx.Includes
   I usually code in the afternoon for around 3 hours (not all week)
   The progress is the same as I have stated in technical plan
