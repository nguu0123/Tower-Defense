First 3 weeks:
   Adding basic game logic: class Grid and the logic classes (direction, velocity,..). Logic class has been tested by manual testing: create test and compare it with result computed by hand
   Making the first enemy type: can find their own way through the map by moving to the next similar square, have running and dieing animation
   Making the first tower type: can target the enemy ans shoot a projectile to it.
   Filemanger can load map and will then be implemented to load and save game
   Handling input from the user is hard and intelliJ mis-compile scalafx with javafx => fix by adding scalafx.Includes
   I usually code in the afternoon for around 3 hours (not all week)
   The progress is the same as I have stated in technical plan
Week 4:
   Adding a display system (player health, gold, current wave)
   Adding gold system: player can know use gold to build tower, receive gold when enemies die or have run to goal
   Changing the grid size to look better, the previous grid and game scence's size is too big
   FileManager are not fully implemented yet -> a bit lagging behind
   However, I have started to implement some GUI component in my game scene -> when the game scene is fully functiong, FileManager will be fully implemented
   I have fixed the fps at around 60 fps so that the game will function the same in different computer.
   My coding routine is still the same
   The progress is not the same as I expected but I think I'm not lagging behind
